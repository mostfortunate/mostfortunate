**About Me**

I am a third year Computer Engineering student at [TMU](https://www.torontomu.ca/) with a passion for building products that solve real-world problems. My current focus is on building projects with Swift, and I look forward to showcasing my work soon. ✨

I am always eager to learn new technologies and challenge myself to grow as a developer. Beyond coding, I enjoy socializing, fitness, and learning Arabic. 🤍
