**About Me**

_Seeking 2026 summer co-op placements (12-16 months)_ 💼

I am a third year Computer Engineering student at [TMU](https://www.torontomu.ca/) with a drive for building products that solve real-world problems. My current focus is on building iOS applications with Swift, and you can check out my progress on [X](https://x.com/bookofnoor). ✨

I am always trying to learn new technologies and challenge myself as a developer. Beyond coding, I enjoy spending time with family, fitness, and learning Arabic. 🤍
